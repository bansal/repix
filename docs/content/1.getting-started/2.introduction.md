Welcome to **Repix**, a high-performance image transformation service built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Hono](https://hono.dev/), and [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/).

## What is Repix?

Repix transforms, optimizes, and delivers images at lightning speed through a simple URL-based API. Point it at any image URL, add transformation parameters, and get back optimized images in modern formats like WebP and AVIF.

## Key Features

- **TypeScript** — Full type safety and better development experience
- **Modern Build** — Vite-powered build system for optimal performance
- **Image Transformations** — Resize, crop, format conversion, quality adjustment
- **Multiple Fit Modes** — cover, contain, scale-down, crop, pad
- **Format Support** — JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF
- **Preset System** — Define reusable transformation presets
- **Environment Configuration** — Support for both config file and environment variables
- **Docker Ready** — Containerized deployment support
- **URL-based API** — Transform images via URL parameters—no SDK required

## How It Works

Repix fetches images from remote URLs, applies transformations using Sharp, and returns the optimized result. The URL pattern is:

```http
https://your-domain.com/{preset|rules}/{source-url-without-prefix}
```

**Using a preset:**

```http
https://your-domain.com/thumbnail/example.com/path/to/image.jpg
```

**Using inline rules:**

```http
https://your-domain.com/w=400,h=300,fit=cover,f=webp,q=85/example.com/path/to/image.jpg
```

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 22.0.0 or higher (required by Sharp and modern ES features)
- **npm** or **yarn** for package management

::tip
Repix uses Sharp for image processing, which requires native bindings. The Docker image includes all necessary dependencies for easy deployment.
