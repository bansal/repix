[Railway](https://railway.app) automatically detects and uses the `Dockerfile` at the root of your repository.

## Deploy Steps

### 1. Create a Project

1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Click **New Project**
3. Select **Deploy from GitHub repo**
4. Connect and choose the `repix` repository

### 2. Configure Service

Railway detects the Dockerfile and builds your image. No extra build config needed.

### 3. Environment Variables

Add variables in **Variables** tab:

| Variable   | Value        |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |
| `PORT`     | `3210`       |
| `PREFIX`   | `https://`   |

### 4. Expose Port

1. Go to **Settings** → **Networking**
2. Click **Generate Domain** to get a public URL

Your Repix instance will be at:

```text
https://repix-production-xxxx.up.railway.app
```

::tip
Railway sets `PORT` automatically. The Dockerfile exposes 3210; Railway maps it correctly.

## Custom Domain

1. **Settings** → **Networking** → **Custom Domain**
2. Add your domain (e.g., `images.yourdomain.com`)
3. Update DNS with the CNAME record Railway provides

## Scaling

Railway supports horizontal scaling. For high-traffic image transformation:

1. **Settings** → **Replicas** — Increase instance count
2. Use Railway's load balancer for distribution

## Dockerfile Path

If using a non-standard path, set:

```text
RAILWAY_DOCKERFILE_PATH=/path/to/Dockerfile
```
