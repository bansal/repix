  title: Migration from Cloudinary - Repix
  description: Migrate image transformations from Cloudinary to self-hosted Repix.
---

Repix provides a self-hosted alternative to Cloudinary. This guide maps Cloudinary transformation parameters to Repix equivalents.

## URL Structure

| Platform     | URL Pattern                                                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cloudinary** | `https://res.cloudinary.com/{cloud}/image/upload/{params}/{path}.{ext}` |
| **Repix**      | `https://your-repix.com/{params}/{path-without-https}`                 |

Repix uses `key=value` parameters separated by commas. The image path is the URL **without** `https://` (Repix adds it automatically).

## Parameter Mapping

Cloudinary uses underscore-separated parameters (e.g. `w_400,h_300,c_fill`). Repix uses `key=value` with commas.

| Cloudinary | Repix | Notes |
| ---------- | ----- | ----- |
| `w_400` | `w=400` | Width |
| `h_300` | `h=300` | Height |
| `c_fill` | `fit=cover` | Fill/crop to exact dimensions |
| `c_fit` | `fit=contain` | Fit within dimensions |
| `c_scale` | `w=W,h=H` (omit one) | Scale proportionally |
| `c_pad` | `fit=pad` | Pad with background |
| `c_limit` | `fit=scale-down` | Like contain, never enlarge |
| `q_auto` | `q=85` (or omit) | Use default quality |
| `q_80` | `q=80` | Quality 1–100 |
| `f_auto` | Omit or `f=webp` | Repix doesn't auto-negotiate; use `f=webp` or `f=avif` |
| `f_webp` | `f=webp` | Output format |
| `f_jpg` | `f=jpeg` | Output format |
| `fl_horizontal` | `flip=h` | Horizontal flip |
| `fl_vertical` | `flip=v` | Vertical flip |
| `a_90` | `rotate=90` | Rotation degrees |
| `e_blur:500` | `blur=10` | Blur (Repix uses 1–250 radius) |
| `b_white` | `background=white` | Background for pad fit |

## Example Conversions

**Cloudinary:**
```http
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/w_400,h_300,c_fill,f_webp,q_85/sample.jpg
```

**Repix:**
```http
https://your-repix.com/w=400,h=300,fit=cover,f=webp,q=85/res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/sample.jpg
```

If your images are on Cloudinary, use the full path without the domain in Repix (Repix adds `https://`).

## Using Presets as Named Transformations

Cloudinary's [named transformations](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/named_transformations) map to Repix presets:

```javascript
// config.js
export default {
  presets: {
    thumbnail: "w=200,h=200,fit=cover,f=webp,q=85",
    banner: "w=1024,h=128,fit=cover,f=webp,q=85",
  },
}
```

```http
https://your-repix.com/thumbnail/example.com/photo.jpg
```

## Migration Steps

1. **Deploy Repix** — Use [Docker](/deployment/render) or your preferred platform. Point a subdomain (e.g. `img.yourdomain.com`) to it.
2. **Configure presets** — Add presets that match your Cloudinary named transforms.
3. **Update image URLs** — Replace the Cloudinary base URL with Repix in your app (e.g. via a helper or env variable).
4. **Source images** — Ensure images are publicly accessible over HTTPS. If migrating from Cloudinary storage, move assets to S3/R2 first, then point Repix at those URLs.
5. **Run in parallel (optional)** — Use a feature flag to switch between Cloudinary and Repix during migration.

## Features Not Supported

Repix focuses on core image transformations. AI cropping, overlays, video, and client hints (DPR auto) are not supported. Use `fit=cover` for cropping and `blur=20` for placeholder effects.
